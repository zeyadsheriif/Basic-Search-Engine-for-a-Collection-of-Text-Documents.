# Basic-Search-Engine-for-a-Collection-of-Text-Documents.

Project Procedures:

1. Data Collection: Gather a set of text documents to serve as your corpus. This could be a collection of articles, web pages, or any other textual content. Ensure the documents are in a format that can be easily parsed and indexed

2. Preprocessing: Tokenization: Split documents into individual words or tokens, Lowercasing: Convert all text to lowercase for case insensitivity, Stopword Removal: Eliminate common words (e.g., "and", "the", "is") that do not contribute much to the meaning of the document, and stemming or Lemmatization: Reduce words to their base or root form (e.g., "running" to "run").

3. Indexing: Build an inverted index, Create a data structure that maps each unique word (or term) to the documents that contain that word, and For each term, maintain a list of document IDs where the term appears along with the frequency of occurrence.
  
4. Query Processing: Implement a simple query processing with expanded capabilities, Parse user queries (input text) and apply the same preprocessing steps (tokenization, lowercase, etc.) as used during indexing,  Identify relevant documents by leveraging the inverted index, Retrieve documents that contain all the terms from the query, and Rank the retrieved documents based ranking algorithm (TF-IDF).

5. Query expansion: Apply relevance feedback by analyzing top-ranked documents for initial queries, and Incorporate synonyms or related terms using pre-built mappings or Embeddings (ELMo and BERT).

6. User Interface: Develop a basic user interface to interact with the search engine, Accept user queries, and Display relevant search results.

7. Evaluation: Evaluate the performance of your search engine, and Test with various queries to assess retrieval accuracy and speed.
